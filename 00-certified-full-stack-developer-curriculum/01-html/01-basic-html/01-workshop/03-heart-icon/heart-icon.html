      The path element needs its shape defined. 
      That is where the d attribute comes in. 
      It is used to create a series of command letters and numbers that draw a shape.
      These letters represent commands like move to, draw line, and close, while the numbers represent coordinates.
      Set the heart shape's d attribute to M12 21s-6-4.35-9.33-8.22C-.5 7.39 3.24 1 8.4 4.28 10.08 5.32 12 7.5 12 7.5s1.92-2.18 3.6-3.22C20.76 1 24.5 7.39 21.33 12.78 18 16.65 12 21 12 21z.
