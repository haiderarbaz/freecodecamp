## üì¶ Div Elements

**What are Div Elements and When Should You Use Them?**

- We are going to look at the Content Division Element - or in other words, the div:
  ```html
  <div></div>
  ```
- Think of the `div` as a beautiful being that can be anything you want it to be. You can give a `div` a `height`, we can give it a `width`, and you can give it a background color using CSS - or in other words styling.

- You can use it in a very basic form without styling to hold other elements together.

- For example, create a `div` and put a heading in it, and put a paragraph in it, and now these two elements will be grouped together:

  ```html
  <div>
    <h1>I am a heading</h1>
    <p>I am a paragraph</p>
  </div>
  ```

- Be aware that there might be better elements to use when grouping these together. You might choose a `section` element.

- For example:

  ```html
  <section>
    <h1>I am a heading</h1>
    <p>I am a paragraph</p>
  </section>
  ```

- This is because the `section` element has semantic meaning.

- Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language.

- In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means if you use a `section` element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it.

## üÜî IDs and Classes

**What Are IDs and Classes, and When Should You Use Them?**

### IDs

- The `id` attribute adds a unique identifier to an HTML element.

- For example, there is an `h1` element with an `id` of `title`:

  ```html
  <h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
  ```

- You can reference the `id` name of `title` within your JavaScript or CSS.

- Below is a CSS example referencing the `id` of `title` to change the text `color` to `red`:

  ```css
  #title {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

  - The hash symbol `(#)` in front of `title`, tells the computer you want to target an `id` with that value.

- `id` names should not be used more than once, and they should always be unique.

- Another thing about `id` values, is that they cannot have spaces in them.

- Below is an example of applying the words `main` and `heading` to an `id` attribute value:

  ```html
  <h1 id="main heading">Main heading</h1>
  ```

  - Browsers will see this space as part of the `id` which will lead to unwanted issues when it comes to styling and scripting.

- `id` attribute values should only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.

### Classes

- The `class` attribute value does not need to be unique and can contain spaces.

- Below is an example of applying a class called `box` to a `div` element:
  ```html
  <div class="box"></div>
  ```
- If you want to add multiple class names to an element, you can do so by separating the names by a space.

- Below is an updated example applying multiple classes to a `div` element:

  ```html
  <div class="box red-top"></div>
  ```

- To apply a set of styles to that box class, you can reference that class inside your CSS.

- Below is an example of setting width, height, and border properties to the element with the class name of box:

  ```css
  .box {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 2px solid black;
  }
  ```

  - The dot symbol (.) in front of box, tells the computer you want to target a class with that value.

- When the code runs, it will search through all of your HTML document to find all elements with that class name and apply those styles.

**Note:**

- Classes are best used when you want to apply a set of styles to many elements.
- If you want to target a specific element, it is best to use id because those values need to be unique.

## üî£ HTML Entities

**What Are HTML Entities, and What Are Some Common Examples?**

- An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML.

- For example, there is a paragraph element with an image element nested inside:

  ```html
  <p>This is an <img /> element</p>
  ```

- The text on the screen should say `This is an <img/> element`. However, the text currently says `This is an element`.
- This is happening because when the HTML parser sees the less than `(<)` symbol followed by an HTML tag name, it interprets that as an HTML element.

- To fix this issue, you can use HTML entities.

- Below is an updated example using the correct HTML entities for the less than and greater than `(>)` symbols.

  ```html
  <p>This is an &lt;img /&gt; element</p>
  ```

- These types of character references are known as named character references. Named references start with an ampersand sign `(&)` and end with a semicolon `(;)`.

- By using a named character reference, the HTML parser will not confuse this with an actual HTML element.

- Here is what the updated paragraph element looks like on the page: `This is an <img/> element`. Now, users will be able to see the entire image element syntax as you intended it.

- Another type of character reference would be the decimal numeric reference.

- Below is an example of using the decimal numeric reference for the less than symbol:

  ```html
  &#60;
  ```

  - This character reference starts with an ampersand sign and hash symbol `(#)`, followed by one or more decimal digits, followed by a semicolon.

- The last type of character reference would be the hexadecimal numeric reference.

- Below is an example of using the hexadecimal numeric reference for the less than symbol:

  ```html
  &#x3C;
  ```

  - This character reference starts with an ampersand sign, hash symbol, and the letter x. Then it is followed by one or more ASCII hex digits and ends with a semicolon.

- Some other examples of using HTML entities, you often see them used for symbols like the copyright symbol `(¬©)`, quotes `(")`, trademark symbol `(‚Ñ¢)`, and the ampersand sign.

## üìú Script Element

**What Is the Role of the Script Element in HTML, and How Can It Be Used to Link to External JavaScript Files?**

- The `script` element is used to embed executable code.

- You will use this to execute JavaScript code.

- JavaScript is used to add interactivity to your web pages.

- Common examples of using JavaScript include interactive games, image sliders, and dynamic forms that validate user input in real-time.

- Below is an example of using the `script` element in an HTML document:

  ```html
  <body>
    <script>
      alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
    </script>
  </body>
  ```

  - In this example, we have an `alert` to display the message `Welcome to freeCodeCamp`.
  - When the page first loads, the alert will pop up. Then the user can click on the OK button to dismiss the message.

- You can technically write all of your JavaScript code inside the script tags, but it is considered best practice to link to an external JavaScript file instead.

- Below is an example of using the script element to link to an external JavaScript file:

  ```html
  <script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>
  ```

  - The `src` attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript file.

  - `src` stands for "source".

  - The reason why it is not encouraged to place all of your JavaScript inside the HTML document is because of separation of concerns.

  - Separation of concerns is a design principle where you separate your programs into distinct sections and have each section address a separate concern.

  - In this case, we want to separate our JavaScript code from our HTML code.

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Divs are generic containers for grouping content
- IDs must be unique; classes can be reused
- HTML entities represent reserved characters
- Script elements link JavaScript to your HTML
