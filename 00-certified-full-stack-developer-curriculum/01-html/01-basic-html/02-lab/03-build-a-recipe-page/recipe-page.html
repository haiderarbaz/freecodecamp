    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>700ml whole milk</li>
      <li>200ml double cream</li>
      <li>100g caster sugar</li>
      <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>3 tbsp cornflour</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the milk and cream in a saucepan and gently bring the mixture to
        just below boiling point.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, cornflour, and
        vanilla extract until they form a smooth paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture while whisking
        constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. This slowly raises the
        temperature of the eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan. Heat gently over a low
        heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the custard
        thickens. Do not let it boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the custard hot or cold. If chilling, cover the surface directly
        with baking parchment or plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming.
