# Build a Recipe Page

In this lab, you'll review HTML basics by creating a web page of your favorite recipe. You'll create an HTML boilerplate and work with headings, lists, images, and more.

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.
