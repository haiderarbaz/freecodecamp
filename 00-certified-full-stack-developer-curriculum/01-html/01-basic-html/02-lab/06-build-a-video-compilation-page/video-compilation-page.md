# Build a Video Compilation Page

In this lab, you'll create a video compilation web page. You'll practice working with the iframe element.

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

<source src="./assets/video-compilation-example-project.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source>
</video>

6. The three `iframe` elements should have a `src` attribute set to a valid video.
