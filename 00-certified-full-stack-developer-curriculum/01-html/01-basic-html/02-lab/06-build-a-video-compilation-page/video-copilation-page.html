      <h1>Backend Development</h1>
      <p>
        Backend development is the server-side of web development, which focuses
        on creating the logic, databases, and APIs that power an application
        behind the scenes. It involves handling tasks like user authentication,
        managing data, and ensuring the application runs efficiently and
        securely, making it the "backbone" that enables the user-facing
        "frontend" to function properly.

          events.
